# EquationsOfStateOfSolids

## Package Features

- Calculate energy, pressure, and bulk modulus of an EOS `Parameters` on a (an)
  volume (array of volumes).
- Fit an `EquationOfState` on a series of volumes using least-squares fitting
  method.
- Fit an `EquationOfState` on a series of volumes linearly.
- Find the corresponding volume of an EOS `Parameters` given an (a) energy,
  pressure, and bulk modulus.
- Handle unit conversion automatically in the above features, take any unit.

See the [Index](@ref main-index) for the complete list of documented functions
and types.
